# limix (Limine + UNIX)

This will be done eventually

## Features

- Graphics
- An overcomplicated system for using multiple processors
- A complex project structure
- Cooperative multitasking disguised as 'async'

## Building

### Option A

Just building it. Without generating clangd files.

```
make
```

### Option B

Generating clangd files.

```
make genComp
```

## Running

Just do `make run-iso` or `make run-hdd`.

The first usally boots faster.
